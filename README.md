## üìä Scoring System

| Scenario                                   | Marks        |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| All test cases passed                      | 10 marks     |
| ‚â•50% test cases passed                     | 5 marks      |
| <50% test cases passed                     | 0 marks      |
| Detected plagiarism via keystroke analysis | 0 marks      |
| Viva (5 questions)                         | 5 marks      |
| **Total**                                  | **15 marks** |

> **Note:** If "change of question" option is used, maximum coding marks are reduced to 7.

## üîí Anti-Plagiarism Measures

The system employs sophisticated keystroke analysis that is Student should type 60% of code (This is done by counting the keystrokes)
When plagiarism is detected:

- The submission is automatically flagged
- Coding score is set to zero
- Student can still complete the viva portion

## üîå External Integrations

- **PISTON API**: Safe code execution environment
- **react-monaco-editor**: Dynamic code editing interface
